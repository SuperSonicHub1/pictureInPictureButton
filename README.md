# Picture in Picture Button
Universal Picture in Picture button/shortcut for Chrome.

This extension adds a universal Picture in Picture button and keyboard shortcut to Chrome, powered by the [Picture in Picture Web API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/watch-video-using-picture-in-picture) introduced by Google in 2018.

Features:
- keyboard shortcut
- PiP element automatically closes on fullscreen
- works on any webpage with a video element*

The keyboard shortcut is Alt + P (‚å• + P on macOS) by default, just like in the original Picture in Picture extension by Google. You can change it to your liking or disable it altogether by going to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`. You can also toggle Picture in Picture by clicking on the extension icon.

## *Limitations:
- doesn't work on extension pages such as Alternative Player for Twitch.tv
- doesn't work on video elements in inline frames such as VRV
