# TODO

* Get the extension working on VRV
    * ~~Perhaps using a content script is in order?~~
    * ~~Try an `<iframe>` fallback.~~
    * __VRV is an anomaly that no one can explain.__
* Troubleshoot `browserAction`
    * Find a subreddit to post to for help.
* Rewrite the Makefile in order to have `make icons` working properly.
