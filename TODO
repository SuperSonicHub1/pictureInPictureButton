    * ~~Perhaps using a content script is in order?~~
    * ~~Try an `<iframe>` fallback.~~
    * __VRV is an anomaly that no one can explain.__
* Troubleshoot `browserAction`
    * Find a subreddit to post to for help.
* Rewrite the Makefile in order to have `make icons` working properly.
* ~~Get `onloadedmetadata` up and running for Bandcamp~~
    * ~~https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/1249/how-to-solve-javascript-exception-failed-to-execute-requestpictureinpicture-on-htmlvideoelement-metadata-for-the-video-element-are-not-loaded-yet~~
    * ~~Just kinda doesn't work... Perhaps I've misinterpreteed the snippet or maybe it doesn't work with `async`.~~
    * ~~Made a second realization, Bandcamp never actually gets past the `readyState` necessary to do PiP. My code now reflects this knowledge.~~
